# Iris Classification

This project classifies iris flowers into species using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset contains features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with code and explanations.
- `src/`: Placeholder for additional code files.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook in `notebooks/`.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 100.00%.
